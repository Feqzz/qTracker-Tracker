# qTracker-Tracker README
A private tracker backend compatible with the [qTracker-Client](https://github.com/Feqzz/qTracker-Client).

# Dependencies
* `Boost 1.23+`

# Documentation
For the time being there is no documentation available. You might find the development process in 
the client's [wiki](https://github.com/Feqzz/qTracker-Client/wiki) interesting.

# Client
The tracker is compatible with our client. It is made with the [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/) and has common private tracker functionalities such as 
hit and runs, ratios, bonus points and invites.
